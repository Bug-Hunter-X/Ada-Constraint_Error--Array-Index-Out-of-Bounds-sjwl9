# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's limits, resulting in a `Constraint_Error` exception. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error using appropriate checks.

This example highlights the importance of careful index handling when working with arrays in Ada to avoid runtime errors.
